		<p> Green Lantern is the name of a number of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. They fight evil with the aid of rings that grant them a variety of extraordinary powers.
The first Green Lantern character, Alan Scott, was created in 1940 during the initial popularity of superheroes. Alan Scott usually fought common criminals in New York City with the aid of his magic ring. The publication of this character ceased in 1949 during a general decline in the popularity of superhero comics, but the character saw a limited revival in later decades.
In 1959, to capitalize on the booming popularity of science fiction, the Green Lantern character was reinvented as Hal Jordan, an officer for an interstellar law enforcement agency known as the Green Lantern Corps. Additional members of this agency, all of whom call themselves Green Lanterns, were introduced over time. Prominent Green Lanterns who also have had starring roles in the books include Guy Gardner, John Stewart, Kyle Rayner, Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz.
The Green Lanterns are among DC Comics' more successful properties. They have been adapted to television, video games, and motion pictures.

		<img id = "hal" src = "img/hal.png">
		<p> Hal Jordan is the greatest Green Lantern, an inter-galactic police officer and member of the Green Lantern Corps, chosen by the Guardians of the Universe for his ability to overcome great fear. The strength of his willpower allows him to wield the universe's mightiest weapon, a power ring controlled by his thoughts. In his secret identity he is a test pilot working for Ferris Aircraft where his boss Carol Ferris is also his romantic interest. Having turned into the evil Parallax during Emerald Twilight and died during Final Night, his soul became a host of the Spectre during Day of Judgment until his resurrection during Green Lantern: Rebirth. Although he is the most well-known Lantern, Alan Scott of the Golden Age is the original version of the character. Other Lanterns that have acted as his partners, successors or replacements at times have included Guy Gardner, John Stewart and Kyle Rayner. He is a founding member of the Justice League of America.
